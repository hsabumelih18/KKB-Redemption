# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
The short of the code of conduct is to be awesome to each other. We are all here to learn, improve, and help each other not only survive, but thrive while improving ourselves.

## Need to report a code of conduct violation?
You can contact "hsabumelih18@codingburgas.bg" directly and privately through the following methods to open a dialog about what happened / is happening and how we can solve it.

Direct message on Teams.
Direct message on Discord.
Direct message in the Group Chat.
No violation is too small to let me know about. I want to keep this community healthy and safe for all members and that means that we crack down on anti-inclusivity as soon as it happens.

## Absence
Giving the fact that we are a 6 member team, we have different schedules. Therefore we try to organize our meetings in a way that they are accessible by all of us.
Giving the fact that we have a project for a short period of time to work, it is unaceptable to skip meetings.
"1 - 3" absences: Not punishable.
"4 - 5" absences: Warning.
"6 +" absences: Dismissing from the team.

## Posting a message about a topic after being asked repeatedly to not post said topic
Advertising in chat without permission
Using harrassing speach towards any people (making fun of technology is ok, making fun of people will result in a timeout)
Violating the Culture of Error and Growth Mindset agreements after being asked to stop.



## Violating the timeout offenses multiple times
Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
Threats of violence
Deliberate intimidation
Sexually explicit or violent material
Unwelcome sexual attention
Stalking or following
Any other kinds of harassment Use your best judgement. If it will possibly make others uncomfortable, do not post it.
Culture of error
This is community focused around learning and constantly improving ourselves. It is near impossible to do this without allowing ourselves the freedom to fail publicly. Brooks models this failing during his streams and all members of the community are encouraged to join in.

Only through risking failure can we learn how not to fail.

## Growth mindset
A growth mindset is one where we understand that people can change through hard work and not giving up. In this community we encourage everyone to adopt a growth mindset where we can adapt to whatever challenges we are facing so that we can not only survive them, but thrive in the face of them.

Only through change can we adapt to handle what life is throwing at us.
